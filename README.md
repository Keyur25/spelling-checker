# Spelling Checker

## About

This is a program that checks the spelling of a given text and if it finds an incorrectly spelt word it will suggest the user with different words. To input the text into the program the user can choose to type it or read it in from a file. It then scans through the text and for every word that is spelt wrong, i.e not in the dictionary, the program compiles a list of similar words. The user can then choose to pick one of the similar words to replace the incorrectly spelt word or if none of the suggestions is what the user wants then they can type a new word to replace the old word. Once this process is completed the corrected text is displayed and the user then has the option to save the corrected text to a file.

I coded this in Java using InteliJ IDEA.
